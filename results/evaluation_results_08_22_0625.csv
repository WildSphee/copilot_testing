How do I apply annual leave?,"To apply for annual leave at Singtel, you need to follow these steps:
1. Log in to HR Central - Time Off.
2. Submit your leave application.
3. Attach any required supporting documentation, such as medical certificates if applicable.
4. Keep your managers and P&C partners updated on your leave application progress [1].

[1]: cite:1 ""Citation-1""","Hello! I'm Luis. To apply for annual leave, you can follow these steps:

1. Check your leave balance: First, make sure you have enough leave balance to cover the duration of your intended leave. You can check your leave balance on HRCentral.
2. Discuss with your manager: Before applying for leave, it's always a good idea to discuss your leave plans with your direct manager. This is to ensure that your leave does not conflict with any important work commitments or projects.
3. Apply for leave on HRCentral: Once you have discussed your leave plans with your manager, you can apply for leave on HRCentral. Simply log in to HRCentral, go to the ""Leave"" tab, and select the type of leave you wish to apply for (e.g., Annual Leave). Enter the dates of your leave and submit your application.
4. Wait for approval: After submitting your leave application, your manager will receive an email notification to approve your leave. Once your leave is approved, you will receive a confirmation email.

Remember, if you are a Regular employee, your annual leave is by calendar year, and your leave entitlements for your new contract year will only be refreshed upon the commencement of your new contract year. If you are a Fixed-term employee, your annual leave is based on your contract year.

I hope this helps! If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.

How many days of annual leave am I entitled to?,"Regular Singtel employees are entitled to different days of annual leave based on their grade category and years of service. Here is a breakdown:
- Operations & Support (OS): 14 working days for under 10 years of service, 21 working days for 10 or more years of service.
- Professional (PF): 18 working days for under 10 years of service, 21 working days for 10 or more years of service.
- Executive and Top Executive (E/TE): 21 working days for under 10 years of service, 24 working days for 10 or more years of service [1].

[1]: cite:1 ""Citation-1""","Based on the information provided, annual leave entitlement is calculated using the formula:

(No. of calendar days from Start Date to End Date / Calendar Days in the year) x Entitlement

As a new hire, your annual leave entitlement is 18 days. If you commence work on May 15th, your pro-rated leave entitlement would be:

(No. of calendar days from May 15th to December 31st / 365) x 18 days

= (231 / 365) x 18

= 11.3 days, rounded down to 11 days

[1]: cite:1 ""Citation-1""","Based on the provided context, the answer to the question ""Can I replace my Annual leave with medical - sick leave"" is no. According to the policy, an employee cannot cancel his/her leave to be replaced by his/her sick leave as sick leave shall not be granted when the employee is on any planned approved leave (e.g., annual leave, maternity leave, statutory childcare leave). This is in line with the MOM guidelines, which state that an employee is not entitled to paid sick leave on the following occasions, even if he is given a medical leave by the doctor: rest days, public holidays, non-working days, during annual leave, during no-pay leave. Therefore, if an employee falls sick on his annual leave, his absence from work would still be treated as annual leave and not sick leave.

It's worth noting that employees who have fully utilized their sick leave can apply for annual leave in the event that they fall sick again, and if they have fully consumed their annual leave, they should apply for no-pay leave.",9.741053295135497,9,Copilot accurately reflects the information provided in the source.,9,Copilot provides accurate information without any errors.,10,Copilot presents information in a clear and straightforward manner.,10,Copilot's response is directly relevant to the question asked.,10,Copilot provides a concise and to-the-point answer.,9,Copilot delivers an excellent answer with minimal room for improvement.

Dear Luis,

Thank you for reaching out to us. Unfortunately, it's not possible to request for a Certificate of Employment (COE) without salary information. The COE is a document that confirms your employment status and includes details such as your job title, employment duration, and salary information.

If you need a COE for a specific purpose, such as applying for a bank loan or a visa, you will need to provide your salary information as part of the application process. The bank or embassy may require this information to verify your employment status and determine your eligibility for the loan or visa.

If you're concerned about privacy, you can ask your HR department to provide you with a COE that only includes your employment status and job title, without any salary information. However, please note that this may not be acceptable to all banks or embassies, and they may require a COE with salary information.

Can i apply Medical Leave with MC obtained from overseas? ,Please upload a medical certificate,"Hi there! As a HR Assistant, I'm happy to help you with your questions. Based on the information provided, it seems that you are asking if you can apply for Medical Leave with a Medical Certificate (MC) obtained from overseas.

The answer is yes, you can apply for Medical Leave with an MC from overseas, but there are some conditions to note. According to the Medical Leave Policy, employees can apply for Medical Leave with an MC issued by a registered medical or dental practitioner. However, the policy also states that supporting documents or medical certificates from non-panel overseas clinics or hospitals are not recognized.

Therefore, if you obtain an MC from an overseas clinic or hospital that is not part of the company's panel, it may not be accepted for Medical Leave purposes. It's always best to check with your HR representative or the company's Medical Leave Policy to confirm the requirements and procedures for applying for Medical Leave with an MC from overseas.

Additionally, as mentioned in the policy, there is no half-day Medical, Sick, or Hospitalisation leave. Employees who are unwell may apply up to 3 days of non-consecutive sick leave in a year without having to attach a medical certificate, which will be deducted from their 14 days sick leave entitlement.

I hope this helps clarify things for you. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or your HR representative.
