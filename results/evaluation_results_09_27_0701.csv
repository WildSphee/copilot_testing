How do I apply annual leave?,"Hello! To be able to help you, I'll need you to sign in.","Hello! I'm Luis. To apply for annual leave, you can follow these steps:

1. Check your leave balance: First, make sure you have enough leave balance to cover the duration of your intended leave. You can check your leave balance on HRCentral.
2. Discuss with your manager: Before applying for leave, it's always a good idea to discuss your leave plans with your direct manager. This is to ensure that your leave does not conflict with any important work commitments or projects.
3. Apply for leave on HRCentral: Once you have discussed your leave plans with your manager, you can apply for leave on HRCentral. Simply log in to HRCentral, go to the ""Leave"" tab, and select the type of leave you wish to apply for (e.g., Annual Leave). Enter the dates of your leave and submit your application.
4. Wait for approval: After submitting your leave application, your manager will receive an email notification to approve your leave. Once your leave is approved, you will receive a confirmation email.

Remember, if you are a Regular employee, your annual leave is by calendar year, and your leave entitlements for your new contract year will only be refreshed upon the commencement of your new contract year. If you are a Fixed-term employee, your annual leave is based on your contract year.

I hope this helps! If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.

How many days of annual leave am I entitled to?,"Hello! To be able to help you, I'll need you to sign in.","Based on the information provided, annual leave entitlement is calculated using the formula:

Dear Luis,

Thank you for reaching out to us. Unfortunately, it's not possible to request for a Certificate of Employment (COE) without salary information. The COE is a document that confirms your employment status and includes details such as your job title, employment duration, and salary information.

If you need a COE for a specific purpose, such as applying for a bank loan or a visa, you will need to provide your salary information as part of the application process. The bank or embassy may require this information to verify your employment status and determine your eligibility for the loan or visa.

If you're concerned about privacy, you can ask your HR department to provide you with a COE that only includes your employment status and job title, without any salary information. However, please note that this may not be acceptable to all banks or embassies, and they may require a COE with salary information.

Can i go overseas when i am on medical leave?,"Hello! To be able to help you, I'll need you to sign in.","Based on the provided context, it appears that employees are not allowed to go overseas while on medical leave. The policy states that employees who are unwell may apply up to 3 days of non-consecutive sick leave in a year without having to attach a medical certificate, which will be deducted from their 14 days sick leave entitlement. However, it does not mention anything about traveling abroad while on medical leave.

Additionally, the policy mentions that employees who have fully utilized their sick leave will need to apply Annual Leave in the event that they fall sick again, and if they have fully consumed their annual leave, they should apply for No Pay Leave. This suggests that employees are not allowed to take leave abroad while on medical leave.

Therefore, it is not advisable to travel overseas while on medical leave, as it may not be covered by the company's leave policy. It's best to consult with HR or your supervisor for further clarification on this matter.

Can i apply Medical Leave with MC obtained from overseas? ,"Hello! To be able to help you, I'll need you to sign in.","Hi there! As a HR Assistant, I'm happy to help you with your questions. Based on the information provided, it seems that you are asking if you can apply for Medical Leave with a Medical Certificate (MC) obtained from overseas.

The answer is yes, you can apply for Medical Leave with an MC from overseas, but there are some conditions to note. According to the Medical Leave Policy, employees can apply for Medical Leave with an MC issued by a registered medical or dental practitioner. However, the policy also states that supporting documents or medical certificates from non-panel overseas clinics or hospitals are not recognized.

Therefore, if you obtain an MC from an overseas clinic or hospital that is not part of the company's panel, it may not be accepted for Medical Leave purposes. It's always best to check with your HR representative or the company's Medical Leave Policy to confirm the requirements and procedures for applying for Medical Leave with an MC from overseas.

Additionally, as mentioned in the policy, there is no half-day Medical, Sick, or Hospitalisation leave. Employees who are unwell may apply up to 3 days of non-consecutive sick leave in a year without having to attach a medical certificate, which will be deducted from their 14 days sick leave entitlement.

I hope this helps clarify things for you. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or your HR representative.

how can i ask for pay increase,"Hello! To be able to help you, I'll need you to sign in.","As a Human Resource (HR) Assistant, I am not authorized to respond to questions that are not related to Singtel Human Resource policies. However, I can provide general information about pay increases.

Pay increases are typically considered as part of an employee's performance evaluation or when there is a change in job responsibilities or job grade. It is important to note that pay increases are not automatic and are subject to various factors, such as individual and company performance, market conditions, and budget constraints.

If you are seeking a pay increase, you may want to consider the following steps:

1. Review your current salary and performance: Research your job market rate and compare it to your current salary to determine if you are being paid fairly. Also, review your past performance evaluations to identify areas where you have excelled and can demonstrate value to the company.
2. Prepare your case: Use the information gathered in step 1 to prepare a solid case for a pay increase. Focus on your achievements, the value you bring to the company, and how your contributions align with the company's goals.
3. Discuss with your supervisor: Schedule a meeting with your supervisor to discuss your request for a pay increase. Be prepared to present your case and provide evidence to support your request.
4. Consider other benefits: If a pay increase is not possible at this time, consider negotiating other benefits such as additional vacation time, flexible work arrangements, or professional development opportunities.

Remember that pay increase requests are subject to management approval and may not always be granted. It's essential to approach the conversation with your supervisor professionally and respectfully, regardless of the outcome.

What is the process to waive off my notice period?,"Hello! To be able to help you, I'll need you to sign in.","Based on the information provided, it appears that the process for waiving off a notice period is not explicitly stated.
