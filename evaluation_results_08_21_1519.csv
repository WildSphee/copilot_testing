2. Submit your leave application.
3. Attach any required supporting documentation, such as medical certificates if applicable.
4. Keep your managers and P&C partners updated on the progress of your leave application and recovery [1].

1. Check your leave balance: First, make sure you have enough leave balance to cover the duration of your intended leave. You can check your leave balance on HRCentral.
2. Discuss with your manager: Before applying for leave, it's always a good idea to discuss your leave plans with your direct manager. This is to ensure that your leave does not conflict with any important work commitments or projects.
3. Apply for leave on HRCentral: Once you have discussed your leave plans with your manager, you can apply for leave on HRCentral. Simply log in to HRCentral, go to the ""Leave"" tab, and select the type of leave you wish to apply for (e.g., Annual Leave). Enter the dates of your leave and submit your application.
4. Wait for approval: After submitting your leave application, your manager will receive an email notification to approve your leave. Once your leave is approved, you will receive a confirmation email.

Remember, if you are a Regular employee, your annual leave is by calendar year, and your leave entitlements for your new contract year will only be refreshed upon the commencement of your new contract year. If you are a Fixed-term employee, your annual leave is based on your contract year.

How many days of annual leave am I entitled to?,"Eligible employees at Singtel are entitled to annual leave based on their years of service. The entitlement varies for different categories of employees, such as Operations & Support, Professional, and Executive/Top Executive, ranging from 14 to 24 working days per calendar year [1].

[1]: cite:1 ""Citation-1""","Based on the information provided, annual leave entitlement is calculated using the formula:

(No. of calendar days from Start Date to End Date / Calendar Days in the year) x Entitlement

As a new hire, your annual leave entitlement is 18 days. If you commence work on May 15th, your pro-rated leave entitlement would be:

(No. of calendar days from May 15th to December 31st / 365) x 18 days

= (231 / 365) x 18

= 11.3 days, rounded down to 11 days

Therefore, you are entitled to 11 days of annual leave.

Can i apply Medical Leave with MC obtained from overseas? ,"Medical certificates from overseas medical clinics or hospitals are not recognized. Only medical certificates issued by overseas panel medical clinics may be recognized for Medical Leave applications [1].

[1]: cite:1 ""Citation-1""","Hi there! As a HR Assistant, I'm happy to help you with your questions. Based on the information provided, it seems that you are asking if you can apply for Medical Leave with a Medical Certificate (MC) obtained from overseas.

The answer is yes, you can apply for Medical Leave with an MC from overseas, but there are some conditions to note. According to the Medical Leave Policy, employees can apply for Medical Leave with an MC issued by a registered medical or dental practitioner. However, the policy also states that supporting documents or medical certificates from non-panel overseas clinics or hospitals are not recognized.

Therefore, if you obtain an MC from an overseas clinic or hospital that is not part of the company's panel, it may not be accepted for Medical Leave purposes. It's always best to check with your HR representative or the company's Medical Leave Policy to confirm the requirements and procedures for applying for Medical Leave with an MC from overseas.

Additionally, as mentioned in the policy, there is no half-day Medical, Sick, or Hospitalisation leave. Employees who are unwell may apply up to 3 days of non-consecutive sick leave in a year without having to attach a medical certificate, which will be deducted from their 14 days sick leave entitlement.

I hope this helps clarify things for you. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or your HR representative.
